# PaCCO
The Preclinical and Clinical Concept Ontology (PaCCO) represents a systematic method of organising and classifying data related to both animal studies and human pharmaceutical information. PACO is constructed from thorough research and analysis of new drug applications (NDAs) integrating the human phenotype (HP) and the mammalian phenotype (MP) ontologies. The observed and non-observed ontological effects were extracted from pharmacological reviews and standard product label documents. These encompassed repeated dose toxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, and developmental toxicity studies. Furthermore, the ontology also includes data from labels, covering areas such as warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions.
